# Summary of changes

- New `code` only identifiers for the classes names
- `is_a` field in ObjectTypeDef keeps track of inheritance
- `previous_versions` encodes metadata about the previous version equivalent object code

- Changed descriptions: $NAME, $SHOW_IN_PROJECT_OVERVIEW, START_DATE, END_DATE
- `$SHOW_IN_PROJECT_OVERVIEW` changed property_label
- Deleted EXPERIMENTAL_STEP.EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS, $ANNOTATIONS_STATE, $XMLCOMMENTS
- Deleted `GMAW_BASE` and `LASER_HYBRID_MAGNET` (Cagtay)
- Fix `ACCREDITATED_CALIBRATION_LAB` to `ACCREDITED_CALIBRATION_LAB`
- Deleted `TASK`, `ACTION`
- Deleted `EXPERIMENTAL_STEP.RM_ETHANOL`, `ACTION.DEVICE_TRAINING`, `ACTION.DEVICE_USAGE`, `EXPERIMENTAL_STEP.MEASUREMENT_SESSION`
- Changed Calibration properties descriptions, sections, and property labels
- Changed `CALIBRATION_PROVIDER` from CONTROLLEDVOCABULARY to VARCHAR
- Deleted `COMPUTATIONAL_ANALYSIS` (now it is `ANALYSIS`)
- Deleted `CONDA_ENVIRONMENT`, `JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK`
- Change vocabulary code `DCPD_POT_CAL` to `DCPD_POT_DROP_CALIBRATION`
- Changed `DCPD_INITIAL_CRACKLENGTH` property code to `DCPD_INITIAL_CRACK_LENGTH`
- Deleted all properties in DCPD which are instrument-specific --> they should be properties of the instrument
- Changed `RAZOR_STROKELENGTH`, `RAZOR_STROKESPEED`, and `RAZOR_STROKECOUNT` to `RAZOR_STROKE_LENGTH`, `RAZOR_STROKE_SPEED`, and `RAZOR_STROKE_COUNT`
- Changed `RAZOR_STROKE_COUNT` from REAL to INTEGER
- Combined `FCG_TEST` and `FCG_STEP` into `FCG_TEST`
- Changed `FINAL_CYCLES` from REAL to INTEGER
- Changed vocabulary code `MICROSCOPY_FCG_CRACK_LENGTH_TYPE` to `MICROSCOPY_FS_TYPE`
- Deleted `EXPERIMENTAL_STEP.FCG_EVALUATION`
- Added detailed measurement metadata (DLS, FTIR, ImageSeries, NMR, ProfileScan, SAXS, SEM, TEM, Video, and LaserDiff PSD) to `activities.py`, carrying over `previous_versions` from the legacy schema and keeping the BFO-informed parent properties untouched.
- Removed the migrated activity definitions from the active legacy model, appended them as a commented block at the end of `object_types_old.py`, and preserved their field descriptions for reference.
- Marked the legacy `EXPERIMENTAL_STEP.*` codes (including DCPD, MS batch, SAXS, SEM, TEM, NMR, DLS, FTIR, Video, thermographic, and LaserDiff PSD) as deprecated in `base.py` to signal that the new v2 activity classes should be used instead.
- **DLS:** `DLS_DISPERSANT` → `DLS.DISPERSANT`, `DLS_TEMPERATURE` → `DLS.TEMPERATURE`, `DLS_CELL_DESCRIPTION` → `DLS.CELLDESCRIPTION`, `DLS_ATTENUATOR` → `DLS.ATTENUATOR`, `DLS_Z_AVERAGE` → `DLS.ZAVG`, `DLS_PDI` → `DLS.PDI`, `DLS_ZETA_POTENTIAL` → `DLS.ZETA`, `DLS_CONDUCTIVITY` → `DLS.COND`.
- **FTIR:** `FTIR_START_WAVENUMBER`, `FTIR_END_WAVENUMBER`, `FTIR_RESOLUTION`, `FTIR_SCAN_COUNT`, `FTIR_ACCESSORY`, `FTIR_FLUSHED_WITH_NITROGEN` now replace `FTIR.*` properties.
- **ImageSeries:** `IMAGE_HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION`, `IMAGE_VERTICAL_RESOLUTION`, `IMAGE_SERIES_COUNT`; we removed the legacy `UUID`.
- **NMR:** `NMR_NUCLEUS_DIRECT`, `NMR_NUCLEUS_INDIRECT`, `NMR_SOLVENT`, `NMR_FREQUENCY`, `NMR_EXPERIMENT_TYPE`, `NMR_SCAN_COUNT`, `NMR_START_CHEMICAL_SHIFT`, `NMR_END_CHEMICAL_SHIFT`, `NMR_IS_QUANTITATIVE`, `NMR_PULSE_ANGLE`, `NMR_INTERPULSE_DELAY`, `NMR_ACQUISITION_TIME`.
- **ProfileScan:** `SCAN_LINE_COUNT`, `SCAN_LINE_RESOLUTION`; the legacy `UUID` is no longer part of the data model.
- **SAXS measurement:** `SAXS_CELL_TEMPERATURE`, `SAXS_EXPOSURE_TIME`, `SAXS_FRAME_COUNT`.
- **SEM:** `SEM_OPERATING_MODE`, `SEM_DETECTOR`, `SEM_ACCELERATION_VOLTAGE`, `SEM_MAGNIFICATION`, `SEM_WORKING_DISTANCE`; we dropped `SEM.INSTRUMENT` and normalized the `SEM.ACCELERATIONVOLTAGE` units (now a VARCHAR placeholder since `keV` in pint is tricky).
- **TEM:** `TEM_OPERATING_MODE`, `TEM_DETECTOR`, `TEM_ACCELERATION_VOLTAGE`, `TEM_MAGNIFICATION`, `TEM_CAMERA_LENGTH`.
- **VideoRecording:** `IMAGE_HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION`, `IMAGE_VERTICAL_RESOLUTION`, `VIDEO_FRAME_PER_SECONDS`, `VIDEO_CODEC`, `VIDEO_DYNAMIC_FRAMERATE`; the old `UUID` field was removed.
- **LaserDiff PSD:** `DISPERSING_MEDIUM`, `SCATTERING_MODEL_PSD_LD`, `REFRACTIVE_INDEX_SAMPLE`, `ABSORPTION_COEFFICIENT_SAMPLE`, `LASER_OBSCURATION`, `LASER_TRANSMISSION`, `MEASUREMENT_MEDIUM_TEMPERATURE`, `PSD_D10`, `PSD_D50`, `PSD_D90`, `MODE_COUNT`.
- Ensured every property keeps its legacy `previous_versions` entry so the mapping to `object_types_old.py` remains explicit, supporting audits and migrations.
